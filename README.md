# UK_genomics_ionomics
Scripts associated with Duckweed thesis by Kellie Smith. These scripts relate to Chapter four for the analysis of UK duckweed cohort including species identification, demography analysis and ionomics of water and duckweed ionomes using ICP-MS

#Genomics
R scripts for:
1. PCA generation.
2. Adegenet for PCA, NJ tree generation and computing Neiâ€™s distances.
3. Metrics for viewing and summarising demography including FST, Pi and Tajima D between species.

Python and bash scripts for:
1. Pruning allelic sites by linkage disequilibrium.
2. ChooseK for deciding k number for structure plot.
3. Plink script for generating bed, bim and fam files for structure analysis.
4. Container_cmd for running structure analysis.
5. Bash script for splitting species into seperate vcf files.
6. Generate population metrics - Pi and Tajima D for each species group and FST for comparing species populations.

#Ionomics
R scripts for:
1. Water ICP-MS analysis (PCA, heat maps).
2. Water ICP-MS radars elements.
3. Water violin plots by species.
4. Duckweed ICP-MS analysis (PCA, heat maps).
5. Duckweed ICP-MS radar elements.
6. Duckweed ICP-MS by species violin plots.
7. Water seasonal line plots.
8. Correlation scatter plots.
9. Map to plot coordinates.
